** Ancillary Services
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  AS
   :END:
   Extra services ERCOT procures to help manage reliability of the transmission system.
   Acquired by ERCOT from QSEs primarily in the DAM, and by supplemental markets closer to real-time if needed.
*** Regulation Service
    Used to manage the risk of sudden changes in [[*Net Load][Net Load]], that is, to both changes in demand
    and changes in the output of [[*Intermittent Renewable Resource][IRRs]].

    Matches generation with demand by responding to frequency deviations at generation resources.
    Issues instructions at a resolution of seconds to increase or decrease generation in-between Base Points.
    Must be capable of ramping through reserved capacity in 5 minutes or less.
    
    | Regulation Service Products     | General Response Requirements                                             |
    |---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Regulation Up                   | within 5 sec                                                              |
    | Regulation Down                 |                                                                           |

    | Fast Responding Regulation Up   | within 60 cycles of ERCOT signal - or - By frequency trigger (+/- 0.09Hz) |
    | Fast Responding Regulation Down |                                                                           |

    Historical Net Load is used to determine how much Regulation will be required in the future.
    ERCOT determines each hourly need for Regulation based on two years of
    Net Load history for the month during which the hour occurs as follows:
    1. Take the 95th percentile of Regulation deployed during the same month over the
       previous two years.
    2. Take the 95th percentile of Net Load changes during the same month over the
       previous two years.
    3. Take the maximum of 1 and 2, this is the base regulation requirement.
    4. Add incremental MWs for additional Wind Generation added during the previous year.
       Details can be found in "Methodology for Determining Minimum Ancillary Service Requirements".
*** Responsive Reserve Service
    Responds within minutes to things like loss of large generator or a large load-ramp.
    Must be fully deliverable within 10 minutes.
    Can provide additional capacity during an Energy Emergency Alert.
*** Non-Spinning Reserve Service
    Used to manage the risk of under-forecasting gradual changes in [[*Net Load][Net Load]].
    Must be fully deliverable (synchronizing and ramping to specified output level) within 30 minutes.
    May be deployed to help with system-wide load that is larger than expected, or with local transmission issues.
    Must be capable of running at a specified output level for at least one hour.
** Base Point
   The level at which a generator (Resource?) has been instructed to produce
   power by ERCOT.
   
   ERCOT issues Base Points to [[*Intermittent Renewable Resource][IRRs]], but most of the time the Base Point
   is merely permissive.
** Base Point Deviation Charge
   Assessed when a Resource's output is not close enough to its [[*Base Point][Base Point]].
*** For Intermittent Renewable Resources
    For an [[*Intermittent Renewable Resource][IRR]] to be charged for a Base Point deviation within a given Settlement Interval,
    the IRR must be curtailed for all [[*Security Constrained Economic Dispatch][SCED]] intervals within the Settlement Interval and
    the IRR must be over-generating (not under-generating) on average compared to their
    average Base Point during the Settlement Interval.
   
    [[*Intermittent Renewable Resource][IRRs]] are allowed a wider tolerance from their Base Point than other Resources.
   
    Note that [[*IRR Group][IRR Groups]] are assessed as an aggregate when calculating the Base Point Deviation Charge.

    | Curtailment Flag | IRR Output within 10% acceptable range | IRR output exceeds 10% acceptable range |
    |------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Not set          | No Charge                              | No Charge                               |
    | Set              | No Charge                              | Charge                                  |
  
    The charge is equal to the amount of over-generation times the maximum of 20 dollars or the [[*Real-Time Settlement Point Price][RTSPP]]: 
    ~Charge = Max(20, RTSPP) * [Average Output - (Base Point + 10% Tolerance)]~
** Bilateral Trade
   QSE to QSE transactions.
   Documented for ERCOT settlement purposes.
   Transfer the financial responsibility of providing energy from the buyer to the seller.
   Buyer ultimately receives credit for the energy during the ERCOT settlement process.
   
   QSEs can make different types of bilateral trades: Energy, Capacity, Ancillary Service.
   
   | Information Needed                       | Energy Trade                  | Capacity Trade           |

*** Energy Trade
    + Affects real-time settlements by adjusting the energy supply or obligation for a given QSE.
    + Affects settlements for subsequent RUCs
*** Capacity Trade
    + Affects settlements for subsequent RUCs
** Capacity
   Total MW capability of resources that are available to ERCOT during an operating hour.
   System Capacity = Ancillary Services Capacity + Available for Energy Dispatch

   There must be enough capacity to serve the Forecasted Load, but the capacity must
   also be distributed sufficiently to manage congestion of the transmission system.

   If market processes do not provide sufficient capacity, then the Reliability Unit Commitment
   process dispatches Resources to provide more capacity.

   QSEs are compelled to make capacity available for Energy Dispatch by the expected Settlement Point Prices for the Real-Time Market.
** Capacity Obligation
   A QSE may be required to provide capacity via one of the following transactions:
   + Adjusted Metered Load
   + Capacity Trades where QSE is seller
   + Energy Trades where QSE is seller
   + Cleared [[*Day-Ahead Market][DAM]] Energy Offers
** Capacity Supply
   A QSE may arrange capacity supplies via one of the following transactions:
   + Commitment of the QSE's Resources
   + Capacity Trades in which the QSE is the buyer
   + Energy Trades in which the QSE is the buyer
   + Cleared [[*Day-Ahead Market][DAM]] Energy Bids
** Capacity Shortfall
   A QSE's capacity shortfall is the difference between the capacity
   required to meet their [[*Capacity Obligation][obligations]] and the capacity they have
   [[*Capacity Supply][arranged]].
   A shortfall only exists if their obligations exceed their arranged
   capacity.
** Congestion
   When a path (transmission line, etc.) is loaded to its limit.
   Keeps us from dispatching additional load via that path.
   This leads to price separation between electrical buses.
   Price separation in Locational Marginal Price is always a sign of transmission congestion.
** Congestion Rent
   Difference in Locational Marginal Price between resource and load buses, multiplied by total load.
   Funds the Congestion Revenue Rights in the Day-Ahead Market.
** Congestion Revenue Rights
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  CRR
   :END:
   Monthly financial instruments that can be purchased by CRR Account Holders
   that may pay or charge the CRR Account Holder if congestion exists on the
   ERCOT system.
   May be used:
   - To hedge actual power delivery costs
   - As investments
   Purchased at auction price and cashed out (settled) at DAM price spread
   between two Settlement Points.
   Auctioned the following time-of-use blocks in one month strips:
   - Off-Peak (0100-0600 and 2200-0000) 
   - Peak Weekday (0700-2200)
   - Peak Weekend (0700-2200)
*** Point-to-Point Obligation
    May provide the holder with a payment or charge in the DAM.
*** Point-to-Point Option
    May provide the holder with a payment in DAM.
** Cost-Optimization Processes
   Reliability-focused processes where we must obtain some reliability goal at the least cost.
   In contrast to Market processes, these processes have no Bids from buyers, only Offers from sellers.
   Buyers are simply "price-takers".
   Cost is optimized by clearing the lowest Offers first until the required goal (such as number of MW needed) is met.
   Real-Time Dispatch is an example of this type of process.
** Current Operating Plan
   :PROPERTIES:

   In the DAM, a QSE pays ~(Sink - Source) * Award~, where
   - ~Sink~ is the DAM SPP at the Sink
   - ~Source~ is the DAM SPP at the Source
   - ~Award~ is the number of MWh awarded to the QSE in the DAM along the link
   Then, in the RTM, a QSE is paid ~(Sink - Source) * Actual~, where
   - ~Sink~ is the RT SPP at the Sink
   - ~Source~ is the RT SPP at the Source
   - ~Award~ is the number of MWh awarded to the QSE in the DAM along the link
** Distribution System
   All lines and equipment below 60kV.
   ERCOT does not model or manage any Distribution System.
** Electrical Bus
   The most granular point modeled in the ERCOT transmission system.
   ERCOT calculates a [[*Locational Marginal Price][Locational Marginal Price]] for every Electrical Bus in the system.
   A bus typically is, but may not be, part of a particular [[*Settlement Point][Settlement Point]].
   Generally speaking, an Electrical Bus is an electrical substation.
*** Load Substation
    Where transmission voltage is stepped down to distribute power to a neighborhood or business district.
*** Generator Substation
    Where a Generation Resource connects to the grid.
*** Substation
    Where two different utilities tie their systems together.

** Intermittent Renewable Resource
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  IRR
   :END:
   A Generation Resource that can only produce energy from variable, uncontrollable
   resources, such as wind, solar, or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity.

   IRRs always run at max capability (unless curtailed) with a permissive Base Point.
   This is in contrast to non-IRRs, that seek to match their Base Points, which typically
   are not at those resources' max capability.

   IRRs generally do not participate in the Day-Ahead Market.

   The ramp rate of an IRR is limited to 20% of the resource's Nameplate Rating per minute.
   This means that when curtailed by ERCOT, an IRR must go from full output to zero output in no less than 5 minutes.
   When released from curtailment, the IRR must go from zero output to full output in no less than 5 minutes.

   ERCOT may request shutdown of IRRs when their output is below 10% of their Nameplate Rating.
*** Resource Types
    There are currently two types of IRRs in ERCOT.
**** Wind-Powered Generation Resource
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ACRONYM:  WGR
     :END:
     An aggregation of wind turbines on the same Electrical Bus.
     Generally, each wind turbine must be of the same model and size, although
     there are exceptions to this rule (Protocol 3.10.7.2 (11)).
     The resource must not reduce ERCOT's ability to model the grid.

     ERCOT updates the [[*Current Operating Plan][COP]] [[*High Sustained Limit][HSL]] to the [[*Short-Term Wind Power Forecast][STWPF]] for the first 168 hours of the [[*Current Operating Plan][COP]]
     for a WGR, but the resource's QSE may override to a lesser value.
**** PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ACRONYM:  PVGR
     :END:
     ERCOT updates the [[*Current Operating Plan][COP]] [[*High Sustained Limit][HSL]] to the [[*Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Forecast][STPPF]] for the first 168 hours of the [[*Current Operating Plan][COP]]
     for a PVGR, but the resource's QSE may override to a lesser value.
*** Telemetry
    More telemetry is required for IRRs compared to traditional generation resources.
**** Meteorological Tower Data
     Measured at the IRR site and reported by the QSE through ICCP Telemetry every 10 seconds.
     Includes:
     + Wind Speed
     + Wind Direction
     + Temperature
     + Barometric Pressure
     + Back Panel Temperature (for PVGRs)
     + Plane of Array Irradiance (for PVGRs)
**** Resource Telemetry
     Operational data that indicates the current condition and capabilities of the IRR.
     Reported by the QSE every 2 to 10 seconds, depending on type of datapoint.
     + Resource status
     + Power output (MW & MVAR)
     + High Sustained Limit
     + Number of turbines (inverters for PVGRs) online, offline, and unknown
**** Outage
     Resource availability data reported by the QSE through the Outage Scheduler.
     There are two types:
     
     + Outage - A Resource that has been removed from service
     + Forced Derate - A portion of a Resource that has been removed from service

     A Forced Derate occurs when a resource loses 10 MW or 5% of its Seasonal Net Max Sustainable Rating due to equipment malfunction,
     and must only be reported if it is expected to last more than 48 hours.
*** Pricing
    Because an IRR is always running at its maximum possible output,
    setting a low price for its power ensures that it is "dispatched" by SCED.
    [[./attachments/ercot/img/irr-pricing-1.png]]

    When there are transmission constraints, the IRR is curtailed.
    While curtailed, the HSL should still represent current net output capability
    of the IRR.
    [[./attachments/ercot/img/irr-pricing-2.png]]
** IRR Group
   A group of two or more [[*Intermittent Renewable Resource][IRRs]] whose performance in responding to Dispatch
   Instructions will be assessed as an aggregate.
   All IRRs in the group must have the same Resource Node, and there are no
   Split Generation Resources allowed in an IRR Group.
   Each IRR in the group is dispatched and metered separately.
** Locational Marginal Price
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  LMP
   :END:
   The cost to serve one additional unit of load at an [[*Electrical Bus][Electrical Bus]].
   LMPs are the building blocks for [[*Settlement Point Price][Settlement Point Prices]].
   ERCOT does not adjust LMP to account for transmission losses, rather it considers losses part of load.
   Note that the LMP is not the "type" of quantity used to settle energy;
   [[*Settlement Point Price][Settlement Point Prices]], which are calculated from LMPs (and may even have the same *value* as an LMP),
   are the "type" of quantity used for financial settlement.

** Markets
   Processes that have both Bids and Offers as inputs.
   Transactions only occur so long as there are compatible Bids and Offers present.
   Market processes optimize for value by clearing the highest bids and lowest offers until sellers are no longer willing to accept what buyers are willing to pay.
*** Day-Ahead Market
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ACRONYM:  DAM
    :END:
    A centralized forward market in which QSEs bid and offer on energy and offer Ancillary Services.
    Facilitated and cleared by ERCOT.
    Clearing co-optimizes for energy and Ancillary Services across an entire day subject to the constraints imposed by the Network Model.
    Inputs:
    - Bids
    - Offers
    - Network Model
    Outputs:
    - Hourly Awards
    - Hourly Prices
**** Offer Types
***** Supply Offer
      Comprised of a Startup Offer, a Minimum Energy Offer, and an Energy Offer Curve.
***** Day-Ahead Market Energy-Only Offer
      An offer to sell energy that is not backed up by physical generation capacity.
      May be offered at any Settlement Point.
      When awarded, a QSE is paid the Day-Ahead settlement point price,
      then must buy the awarded amount of energy the following day in the Real-Time
      market at the Real-Time Settlement Point Price.
      This provides an opportunity to make money when Real-Time prices are lower than Day-Ahead prices.
      Tends to drive Day-Ahead and Real-Time prices closer together.
***** Ancillary Service Offer
      Offered at a specific resource, primarily in the DAM.
      May be:
      - Regulation Up
      - Regulation Down
      - Responsive Reserve
      - Non-Spinning Reserve
      A single resource may be used to make multiple AS offers, as well as AS and Supply offers.
**** Bid Types
***** Energy Bid
      A proposal to buy energy in the Day-Ahead Market.
      May be bid at any Settlement Point.
      When awarded, a QSE pays the Day-Ahead Settlement Point Price and is given a credit in the Real-Time market for the energy awarded.
      Then, in Real-Time, if the QSE:
      - Has load         , the credit offsets the energy they must buy to serve the load
      - Doesn't have load, they are paid for the credited amount of energy at the Real-Time Settlement Point Price
      Provides an opportunity for a QSE with no load to make money when Day-Ahead prices are lower than Real-Time prices.
***** PTP Obligation Bid 
      Defined by:
      - Two Settlement Points: a Source and a Sink.
      - A MW quantity
      - The ~Sink - Source~ SPP difference willing to pay
      Being awarded a bid results in either a payment or a charge in the Real-Time Market.
      A QSE specifies the MW quantity

** Peaker Net Margin
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  PNM
   :END:
   A representation of the net revenue a Peaker Resource could have captured
   while generating in the Real-Time Market during high-demand and high-price events.

   Calculated every 15 minutes by approximating the total revenue available to all online
   resources during the Real-Time Market and subtracting the approximate operating cost for a
   Peaker Resource.

   A 15-minute value of when the Real-Time Energy Price is greater than operating costs of a Peaker Resource.

   PNM = Max[(RTEP - POC) * 1/4 h, 0]

   | RTEP | Real-Time Energy Price | HB_HUBAVG              |
   | POC  | Peaker Operating Cost  | 10 * Fuel Index Price  |

   HB_HUBAVG is the Ercot Hub Average Hub Price.
   The Fuel Index Price is the daily Houston Ship Channel Gas Price Index for the previous business day.
*** Threshold
    Three times the cost of entry for new generation (currently $315,000 per MW).

    When the sum of the Peaker Net Margin (across every 15-minute interval throughout the year) is greater
    than or equal to the threshold, the SWCAP is reduced for the remainder of the year to
    Max[$2000, (50 * Fuel Index Price)].
** Probability of Exceedance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  POE
   :END:
   An hourly time series of MW values that an IRR's generation output is
   forecasted to exceed with a certain probability.
   For example, the 50% POE for a given IRR might be 10 MW at 11 AM, 14 MW at 12 PM, etc.
   Calculated from an ensemble of hourly forecast models for IRR resource types.

** RUC Capacity Short Charge
   When a Resource is committed by ERCOT through a [[*Reliability Unit Commitment][RUC]], the QSE is not paid, but
   is guaranteed future payment.
   If normal Real-Time revenues are not sufficient to cover costs for the
   Resource to start and run, then the QSE gets a Make-Whole Payment from ERCOT.
   ERCOT funds the Make-Whole Payment by collecting the RUC Capacity Short Charge
   from QSEs that have [[*Capacity Shortfall][Capacity Shortfalls]].
   
   Whenever ERCOT commits capacity in a [[*Reliability Unit Commitment][RUC]] process, it calculates
   each QSE's Capacity Shortfall both at the time the [[*Reliability Unit Commitment][RUC]] is executed
   and at the close of the adjustment period the hour.
   The larger of these two values is used to determine the shortfall charge.
** Resource

     + Settled at the Real-Time SPP for a Load Zone
**** Emergency Response Service
     :PROPERTIES:

     :END:
     Provides services during an Energy Emergency Alert to assist in maintaining or restoring ERCOT system frequency.
     QSEs may provide two types of services from their ERS resource fleet.
     + Can be load that is capable of curtailment
     + Can be a generator, but it cannot be registered as a Generation Resource with ERCOT and it cannot be an intermittent renewable generator
     + Can be an aggregation of a load and a generator

**** Peaker
     Provides energy during high-demand or high-price events.
**** Wholesale Storage Load
     Stores energy when it is not wanted (during high supply and low demand, low prices, or high system frequency).
     Releases energy when it is wanted (during high demand, high prices, or low system frequency).
     Modeled as a load and generator pair.
     
     Must be metered separately from other facilities,
     because the load for a Wholesale Storage Load
     (the energy used for charging the resource) is settled differently than other load.
     The load is settled at a Resource Node, meaning its price is localized,
     unlike other loads, which are settled at geographical average prices.
     The load is also exempt from Load Ratio Share charges and payments.
     Releasing energy from the resource is treated the same as any other wholesale
     energy sale.

     Limited to the following technologies:
     + Batteries
     + Flywheels
     + Compressed air energy storage (CAES)
     + Pumped hydro-electric power

     - For each transmission system path:
       - Flow limits
       - Current flows

   - System capabilities (from Network Operations Model)
** Settlement Point
   A location at which energy in the ERCOT Market is settled. 
*** Resource Node
    Represents the point where a generator connects to the transmission system.
    There is one Resource Node for each Generation Resource in ERCOT.
    Provides a localized price for settling the output of the generator.
*** Load Zone
    Represents a geographical grouping of Loads.
    Provides a regionalized price that reflects the delivery cost to that group of loads.
    All Load is assigned to one specific Load Zone for settlement purposes.
    There are 13 Load Zones in ERCOT.

** Settlement Point Price
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  SPP
   :END:
   The price for energy on the wholesale market at a [[*Settlement Point][Settlement Point]].
   Settlement Point Prices are calculated from [[*Locational Marginal Price][Locational Marginal Prices]]
*** Day-Ahead Settlement Point Price
    Calculated hourly in the Day-Ahead Market.
**** At Resource Node
     Equal to the resource node LMP.
**** At Load Zone
     Equal to load-weighted average of LMPs within the load zone
     (where load is measured at electrical buses within the load zone).
     For example, if we have a Load Zone that contains four Eletrical Buses,
     and the LMPs and fractions of load served are:
     | LMP | Load Fraction |
     |-----+---------------|
     | $20 |           10% |
     | $20 |           20% |
     | $40 |           30% |
     | $50 |           40% |
     then the SPP for the Load Zone is $38.

     Note that this means customers in the Load Zone don't pay the highest LMP,
     but also don't pay the lowest.
**** At a Hub
     Equal to simple average of LMPs at the 345 kV buses that make up the Hub.
*** Real-Time Settlement Point Price

    Start of SPP calculation period does not always align with start of an LMP
    calculation period.
    Start of Online Reserve Price Adder calculation period does not always
    align with start of an LMP calculation period.
**** At Resource Node
     ~RTSPP = RTRSVPOR + RTRDP + Time-Weighted Average (LMPs)~
     Time-weighted average of real-time LMPs at the resource node plus a
     time-weighted average of Online Reserve Price Adders (Online Reserve Price).
     (The period over which the time-weighted averages are calculated is the
     15 minute settlement point price period).
**** At Load Zone
     1. Load-weighted average of LMPs across all Buses in Load Zone are calculated at each five minute interval
     2. Time-weighted average of the load-weighted averages are calculated
     (The period over which the time-weighted averages are calculated is the 15 minute settlement point price period).
     Settlement Point Price is (2) plus Online Reserve Price.
**** At Hub
     1. Time-weighted average of LMPs for each bus in Hub is calculated
     2. Simple average of time-weighted averages is calculated across all buses
     (The period over which the time-weighted averages are calculated is the 15 minute settlement point price period).
     Settlement Point Price is (2) plus Online Reserve Price.

** Subsynchronous Resonance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ACRONYM:  SSR
   :END:
   Resonant currents in transmission lines of frequencies below 60 Hz.
   May induce internal voltages in generators and damage them.
   Guarded against by an Initial SSR screening by ERCOT, performed when a new
   generation resource requests interconnection.
   If the screening finds a chance that the proposed generator will become radial
   to a series capacitor under some set of transmission outages, then the interconnecting
   [[*Transmission Service Provider][Transmission Service Provider]] must conduct a Vulnerability Assessment.
   If the assessment shows that the proposed generator is vulnerable to SSR,
   countermeasures must be deployed by the interconnecting entity, and those
   countermeasures must be deployed prior to Initial Synchronization of the resource.

   Annual SSR review is also conducted by ERCOT for all generation resources in the
   planning model.
   If a generator is found to be vulnerable to SSR, then the [[*Transmission Service Provider][TSP]] that owns the affected
   series-compensated line must conduct a Vulnerability Assessment.
   If countermeasures are required, the [[*Transmission Service Provider][TSP]] is responsible for them, and they
   must be deployed prior to the latter of completion of the transmission project that
   introduces the vulnerability or the initial synchronization of the affected
   generation resource.

* Ideas/Scratchpad
  What would happen if a new generator came online along a transmission line
  operating at 70% capacity that carried power from a coal plant? If the new
  generation was cheaper than coal and powerful enough to saturate the
  transmission line, and then some, would it be PHYSICALLY bumping the coal
  plant offline (in addition to economically bumping it offline)? If so, would
  a cheap (or even profitable) way to decomission a coal plant be to
  strategically position a different generator along its transmission line?
  Would it be possible to even just subsidise generators along that existing
  transmission line so that they are always bumped up in the merit order ahead
  of coal?

  ERCOT adds transmission losses to the LOAD, meaning that consumers are the
  ones that pay for an inefficient transmission system, rather than generators.
  
  As of 2017, there were about 78 GW of capacity in ERCOT, and the peak demand
  record was 71 GW on August 11, 2016.
